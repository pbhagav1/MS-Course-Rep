# Cloud Computing 
This folder contains the assignments of the course Cloud Computing in Spring 2016.

### [Benchmark Programs] (https://github.com/pbhagav1/MS-Course-Rep/tree/master/Cloud%20Computing/Benchmark%20Programs)
This assignment is to benchmark the CPU, Memory and Disk performances of a Amazon EC2 T2.micro instance. 
The results would be compared against the different standard benchmark programs.

### [Data Sort] (https://github.com/pbhagav1/MS-Course-Rep/tree/master/Cloud%20Computing/Data%20Sort)
This assignment is to sort 10GB and 100GB datasets using Hadoop. Clusters of 1 node and 16 nodes are created.

### [Private and Public Cloud Cost Estimate] (https://github.com/pbhagav1/MS-Course-Rep/tree/master/Cloud%20Computing/Private%20and%20Public%20Cloud%20Cost%20Estimate)
This assignment is to estimate and compare the cost of running applications of different CPU requirements on private and public cloud.
Eight different instances of Amazon EC2 are chosen and costs are estimated and 
the costs for constructing the Private cloud system of the same EC2 instances are also estimated and both the costs are compared.

### [Task Execution Framework] (https://github.com/pbhagav1/MS-Course-Rep/tree/master/Cloud%20Computing/Task%20Execution%20Framework)
This assignment is to create a Task execution framework where multiple clients issue sleep commands to single server.
Amazon SQS is used to communicate the messages between client and server.
Amazon DynamoDB is used to restrict the server from executing the same task multiple times.
